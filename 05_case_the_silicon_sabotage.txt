###Case 005: The Silicon Sabotage
QuantumTech, Miami’s leading technology corporation, was about to unveil its groundbreaking microprocessor called “QuantaX.” Just hours before the reveal, the prototype was destroyed, and all research data was erased. Detectives suspect corporate espionage.

**Objectives**
1. Find who sabotaged the microprocessor.

**Investigation Process**

#1.Understanding the incident

SELECT id, date, location, description
FROM incident_reports
WHERE location LIKE '%QuantumTech%';

#Insight: The incident occurred on 1989-04-21 at QuantumTech HQ. The report confirmed that a prototype was destroyed and research data erased from servers, indicating deliberate internal sabotage.


#2. Reviewing witness statements

SELECT *
FROM witness_statements
WHERE incident_id = 74;

#Insight: Two technical clues emerged from witnesses: Employee 145 mentioned a server located in Helsinki; Employee 134 observed a keycard marked “QX-” followed by a two-digit odd number. / These clues pointed to both digital access and physical facility access.


#3. Correlating server access with keycard usage

SELECT
    c.employee_id,
    c.access_date,
    c.server_location,
    k.keycard_code,
    k.access_date,
    k.access_time
FROM computer_access_logs c
INNER JOIN keycard_access_logs k
    ON c.employee_id = k.employee_id
WHERE c.server_location = 'Helsinki'
  AND k.keycard_code LIKE 'QX-0%';


#Insight: This intersection isolated a small group of employees who: accessed the Helsinki server; used a QX-series keycard on the same day / Among them, employee_id 99 matched the witness description exactly (odd-numbered keycard).


#4. Identifying the technical executor

SELECT *
FROM employee_records
WHERE id = 99;

#Insight: Elizabeth Gordon (id 99), Department: Engineering, Role: Solutions Architect / Her access matched all technical indicators, suggesting she executed the system-level access, but not necessarily the sabotage itself.


#5. Investigating communications around the executor

SELECT *
FROM email_logs
WHERE sender_employee_id = 99
   OR recipient_employee_id = 99;

#Insight: Email analysis revealed coordination that suggested Elizabeth acted after being prompted, not independently.


#6. Expanding the investigation to a coordinating party

SELECT *
FROM employee_records
WHERE id = 263;

SELECT *
FROM email_logs
WHERE sender_employee_id = 263
   OR recipient_employee_id = 263;


#Insight: Two critical emails were identified with sender_employee_id = NULL, indicating system-triggered or anonymized messages. The content revealed explicit orchestration: directing Elizabeth (“L”) into Facility 18; emphasizing precise timing; ensuring audit logs would implicate the correct individual.


#7. Verifying physical access to Facility 18

SELECT *
FROM facility_access_logs
WHERE facility_name = 'Facility 18';

#Insight: The logs showed a decisive access to Facility 18 at 09:01, immediately following the window described in the emails.


#8. Identifying the final executor of the sabotage

SELECT *
FROM employee_records
WHERE id = 297;

#Insight: Hristo Bogoev (id 297), Department: Engineering, Role: Principal Engineer. Hristo was the last individual to access Facility 18 during the critical time window, aligning precisely with the orchestrated plan described in the anonymized emails.
