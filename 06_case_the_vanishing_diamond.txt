At Miami’s prestigious Fontainebleau Hotel charity gala, the famous “Heart of Atlantis” diamond necklace suddenly disappeared from its display.

**Objectives**
1. Find who stole the diamond.


**Investigation Process**

#1. Understanding the crime scene

SELECT * FROM crime_scene
WHERE location = 'Fontainebleau Hotel';

#Insight: The crime occurred at the Fontainebleau Hotel. Witnesses indicated that, among many guests, only two provided relevant clues: 
a famous actor; a female consultant whose first name ends with “an”.


#2. Identifying the actor witness

SELECT g.id, name, occupation, invitation_code, clue FROM guest g
LEFT JOIN witness_statements w ON g.id = w.guest_id
WHERE occupation = 'Actor';

#Insight: The actor who provided a clue was: Clint Eastwood (id 129) / “I overheard someone say, ‘Meet me at the marina, dock 3.’” / This suggested a planned meeting away from the hotel.


#3. Identifying the consultant witness

SELECT g.id, name, occupation, invitation_code, clue FROM guest g
LEFT JOIN witness_statements w ON g.id = w.guest_id
WHERE occupation = 'Consultant' AND clue IS NOT NULL;

#Insight: The second witness was: Vivian Nair (id 116) / “I saw someone holding an invitation ending with ‘-R’. He was wearing a navy suit and a white tie.”


#4. Following the invitation and attire clues

SELECT
g.id,
name,
occupation,
invitation_code,
note
FROM guest g
LEFT JOIN attire_registry a ON g.id = a.guest_id
WHERE note = 'navy suit, white tie'
AND invitation_code LIKE '%-R';

#Insight: Only one guest matched both criteria: Mike Manning (id 105) / Occupation: Wealth Reallocation Expert / Invitation code: VIP-R / Attire: navy suit, white tie


#5. Verifying through final interviews
