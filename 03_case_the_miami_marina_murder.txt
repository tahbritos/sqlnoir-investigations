**Objectives**
1.Find the murderer. ( Start by finding the crime scene and go from there )


**Investigation Process**

#1. Understanding the crime scene

SELECT * FROM crime_scene
WHERE location = 'Coral Bay Marina'

#Insight: The body of an unidentified man was found near the docks. Witnesses reported seeing two individuals nearby: one who lives on “300ish Ocean Drive”; another whose first name ends with “ul” and last name ends with “ez”.


#2. Identifying initial suspects based on witness description

#Suspect living on Ocean Drive
SELECT id, name, occupation, address
FROM person
WHERE address LIKE '%Ocean Drive%';

#Insight: This query returned: Carlos Mendez (id 101) — Fisherman, 369 Ocean Drive.

#Suspect with name pattern “ul ez”
SELECT id, name, occupation, address
FROM person
WHERE name LIKE '%ul %ez';

#Insight: This query returned: Raul Gutierrez (id 102) — Nightclub Owner.


#3. Reviewing interviews of initial suspects

SELECT *
FROM interviews
WHERE person_id IN (101, 102);

#Insight: The interviews did not conclusively identify the perpetrator, suggesting the need to explore additional evidence.


#4. Investigating hotel activity near the incident date

SELECT *
FROM hotel_checkins
WHERE check_in_date = 19860813
  AND hotel_name LIKE '%Sunset%';

#Insight: The result set was too large to directly identify a suspect, requiring a more refined approach.


#5.Narrowing down suspicious behavior using surveillance records

SELECT 
    h.person_id,
    p.name,
    h.hotel_name,
    h.check_in_date,
    s.suspicious_activity
FROM hotel_checkins h
LEFT JOIN surveillance_records s
  ON h.id = s.hotel_checkin_id
LEFT JOIN person p
  ON h.person_id = p.id
WHERE h.check_in_date = 19860813
  AND h.hotel_name LIKE '%Sunset%'
  AND s.suspicious_activity IS NOT NULL;


#Insight: Two individuals displayed suspicious behavior: Jacob Campbell (id 27) — Left suddenly at 3 AM / Gregory Stewart (id 39) — Spotted entering late at night


#6. Reviewing interviews of newly identified individuals

SELECT *
FROM interviews
WHERE id IN (27. 39);

#Insight: Jacob appeared to be an eyewitness, mentioning unusual movements near dock C around midnight. / Gregory reported seeing an unfamiliar yacht that disappeared after the incident, suggesting observation rather than involvement.


#7. Reviewing confessions table

#To narrow the focus, confessions were filtered for all suspects identified so far.
SELECT *
FROM confessions
WHERE person_id IN (101, 102, 27, 39);

#Insight: None of these individuals confessed to the crime.


#8. Exploring an alternative investigative path: occupational access

#Given the crime scene (docks), a new hypothesis was considered: Individuals whose occupations naturally place them at the docks would attract less suspicion.

SELECT DISTINCT occupation
FROM person;

#Based on this, the investigation focused on Fishermen and Dock Workers.

SELECT *
FROM person
WHERE occupation = 'Fisherman'
   OR occupation = 'Dock Worker';


#9. Verifying confessions of dock-related workers

SELECT *
FROM confessions
WHERE person_id IN (1, 8, 101);

**Conclusion**
Among the individuals with legitimate access to the docks, Thomas Brown (id 8) confessed to the crime.
