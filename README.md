# SQL Investigative Cases – SQLNoir

This repository contains a collection of investigative cases solved using SQL.
Each case simulates a crime or incident scenario that requires structured querying,
logical deduction, and analytical reasoning with incomplete or imperfect data.

The cases are based on challenges available on **SQLNoir**:

## 🔍 What this project demonstrates

- SQL querying (JOINs, subqueries, CTEs)
- Logical reasoning and hypothesis testing
- Pattern recognition using structured data
- Investigative and analytical thinking
- Working with ambiguous and incomplete information

This project focuses not only on *writing SQL*, but on **thinking with SQL**.

## 🧠 Investigation approach

Each case follows a consistent analytical structure:

1. Understanding the crime or incident context  
2. Identifying relevant data sources  
3. Narrowing suspects through evidence-driven queries  
4. Validating hypotheses using cross-table analysis  
5. Reaching a defensible conclusion  

The emphasis is on **clarity of reasoning**, not query complexity for its own sake.
